# NISE_saliency
## Multiple feature saliency model development and human data verification.
Testing multiple architectures and features and their influence in human saliency/attention model.

Planned architectures:
1) bottom-up saliency model from Itti & Koch including center surround and multiple scales [1, 2]
2) convolution-based handcrafted architecture [3]

Planned features:
1) Information based (AIM) [8]
2) Graph-based (GBVS) [9]
3) Saliency with natural statistics (SUN) [10]
4) Global contrast / salient object extraction (Computer Vision) [14] or [15]
Skin and color detection (Range detection, Backprojection) [6]
Saliency map (FASA - Fast, Accurate, and Size-Aware Salient Object Detection) [6]
5) Face detection (Haar Cascade)[6]
6) Image Signature (fore vs background) [13, 6]

Additional optional features:
1) Top-down control with gaze “cone” [ 6]
2) Boolean Map [11]
3) Based on log-spectrum [12]
4) Histogram-based classification (Histogram Intersection) [6]
5) Motion detection (Frame differencing, MOG, MOG2) [6]
6) Motion tracking (Particle filter) [6]
